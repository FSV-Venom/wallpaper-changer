# Wallpaper Changer
A simple prank script that changes your, or your friend's wallpaper to an image of your choice.

# Setup
On the first line after the shebang, you will find a variable. Change the variable to the path of your desired wallpaper image.

```bash
#!/bin/bash


# ↓↓ CHANGE to the full path of your desired wallpaper ↓↓
desiredWallpaper="/Users/johnbradford/Desktop/wallpaper.jpg"
```
The script will handle the rest ;)
